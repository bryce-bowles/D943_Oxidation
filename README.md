# D943_Oxidation
Oxidation Characteristics of Inhibited Mineral Oils

Developed and a quantile regression forest predictive model including 80% prediction intervals for Aftonâ€™s Industrial fluid R&D section. The D943 Oxidation lifetime (ASTM D943) model was validated under multiple scenarios to ensure reproducibility and generalization such as comparing with Gaussian Process Models, Principal Component Regression, lasso regression etc.
